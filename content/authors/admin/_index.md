## **Hi, I'm Sushmita!**

<p align="justify">

I'm a data scientist at the <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/n3lab/about/"> Northwestern Neighborhood and Network Initiative </a> at Northwestern University. I use statistics, network science and machine learning to work on a variety of projects on gun violence and police misconduct in Chicago. As N3's first data science hire, I also work on setting up computing infrastructure and data pipelines for the lab. My primary tools are Python and R, with occasional recourse to SQL. 
<br /><br />
I'm proud to be a co-organizer at the wonderful <a href = "https://rladieschicago.org/"> Chicago chapter</a> of R-Ladies. R-Ladies is a global support and advocacy group for women and gender minorities who use R. We now have a presence in 149 cities across the world and over 50,000 members!
<br /><br />
I arrived at data science by way of Economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (<a href = 'https://www.iitm.ac.in/'>IIT-M</a>), policy research at the Institute for Financial Management and Research (<a href='http://ifmrlead.org/'>IFMR</a>), and <a href='https://macss.uchicago.edu/'>Computational Social Science</a> at the University of Chicago. I'm easily excited by the application of statistical and computational methods in public health, media and popular culture. 

<br /><br />
I tweet frivolities <a href='https://twitter.com/SushGopalan'> @SushGopalan </a> and post photos of flowers, Hyderabad and Lake Michigan <a href='https://www.instagram.com/sushmitavgopalan/' </a> @sushmitavgopalan.
