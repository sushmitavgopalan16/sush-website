## **Hi, I'm Sushmita!**

<p align="justify">

I'm a data scientist at the <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/n3lab/about/"> Northwestern Neighborhood and Network Initiative </a> at Northwestern University. I use statistics, network science and machine learning to work on a variety of projects on gun violence and police misconduct in Chicago. As N3's first data science hire, I also work on setting up computing infrastructure and data pipelines for the lab. My primary tools are Python and R, with occasional recourse to SQL.

<br /><br />
I'm proud to be a co-organizer at the wonderful <a href = "https://rladieschicago.org/"> Chicago chapter of R-Ladies </a>. R-Ladies is a global support and advocacy group for women and gender minorities who use R. We now have a presence in 149 cities across the world and over 50,000 members!

<br /><br />
I arrived at data science by way of Economics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, policy research at the Institute for Financial Management and Research, and Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago. I'm easily excited by the applications of statistical and computational methods in public health, media and popular culture.

I tweet frivolities at <a href='https://twitter.com/SushGopalan'> @SushGopalan </a> and post photos of flowers, Hyderabad and Lake Michigan at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/sushmitavgopalan/' </a> @sushmitavgopalan.
